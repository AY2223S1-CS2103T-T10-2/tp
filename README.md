# FABook

Figure: A mockup of our application

**FABook** is an application for **mid tier financial advisors** who have
to manage **countless** potential and current clients.<br>

Many financial advisors have **trouble scheduling** for meet-ups due to
information overload of their clients.<br>

**FABook** is optimized for a **one-stop storage solution** to store and remind them on
**everything** they need to know about their client.

* FABook allows financial advisors to create contact cards to store all **crucial information** about their clients. So they can exude a prepared and confident aura that will help them win over their clients.
<br>
* FABook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for a financial adviser to use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FABook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Example usages:
  * Contact book for storing contacts.
  * Meeting and scheduling reminder.
  * Information storage.
