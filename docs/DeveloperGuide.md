### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `CreateCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
   1. `UndoableCommand` is another interface that extends from the `Command` interface which represents commands that have undo/redo logic.
   2. Commands that implements `UndoableCommand` are managed in the `CommandManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command (an undoable command)](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:
 f
<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramV2. png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagramV2.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramV2.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Opening of Person specific PDF files

Implementation of the opening PDF file of client feature is built on top of the way that the PDF filepath is stored.

#### Implementation

The mechanism is facilitated by `SetPersonFileCommand` and `FileUtil`.

`SetPersonFileCommand` extends from `Command`. It overwrites the `Command#execute()` method to determine if the given filepath is valid and create an "EditedPerson" `Person` object.

The `FileUtil#checkValidPdfFilePath()` method is used in `SetPersonFileCommand` to check the validity of the file path. The method follows the given filePath to check if the file exists and if the given filepath is of type `.pdf`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the set file mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user decides to add a file path to  the 2nd person in the current list of contacts in the address book using the `filepath 2 f/C:\Users\Eugene Tay\Downloads\Tutorial_8_qns.pdf` command.

Step 3. `LogicManager` calls `LogicManager#execute()` method that was implemented from `Logic` interface. Within the method, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` is called on the user input `filePath` and a `Command` object is returned.

Step 4. `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` will parse the user input and match the `COMMAND_WORD` to be `filepath` which is `SetPathFileCommand#COMMAND_WORD` `SetPathFileCommandParser` object is instantiated which parses and checks the user arguments.

Step 5. `SetPathFileCommandParser` object parses the given user arguments. If the `PREFIX_FILEPATH` is present and there is no `IllegalValueException`, a `SetPersonFileCommand` object is instantiated with `index` and `filePath` obtained from the user arguments.

Step 6. `SetPathFileCommand#execute()` method is called in `LogicManager`. This method will check if the given PDF filepath is valid with `FileUtil#checkValidPdfFilePath()` method.

Step 7. `SetPathFileCommand#execute()` method will instantiate a new `Person` object with the original `Person` object's attributes and the new filePath. This `Person` object be set in `Model` and updated in `filterPersonList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the assigning filepath to a client works up till the setPersonFileCommand.
![SetPersonFileSequenceDiagram](images/DeveloperGuide/FilePath/FilePathSequenceDiagram.png)

The next sequence diagram shows how setPersonFileCommand works.
![SetPersonFileSequenceDiagram](images/DeveloperGuide/FilePath/FilePathExecute().png)

The following activity diagram shows how the assigning filepath to a client feature works.
![SetPersonFileActivityDiagram](images/DeveloperGuide/FilePath/FilePathActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Choice 1 (Current Choice) : Store PDF's absolute path.**
  * Pros:
    * Absolute path of the PDF would mean that changes to the file location of User's FABook will not affect the ability to open PDF.
  * Cons:
    * Changing file location of PDF will render stored filepath useless.

**Choice 2 : Store PDF files of clients in a folder.**
  * Pros:
    * Users do not need to input absolute path as it is more technical than relative paths.
  * Cons:
    * Changes to the file location of User's FABook will mean that the PDF cannot be opened anymore since it is relative to the filepath of FABook.

### Person Enhancement

#### Enhancement
The person model now contains a `Net Worth` field.
`Net Worth` is implemented as a class where it contains a `final string value`, `final static string`
`MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS` and `final static string` `VALIDATION_REGEX`.

- Net Worth accepts a Net Worth object that has an immutable value.
- Net Worth is a compulsory field. A user will only engage with a client if they know their net worth.
- Net Worth `VALIDATION_REGEX` ensures that clients of more than 1000 dollars is engaged and the currency is
  standardise to be in dollars

#### Design Considerations

* **Choice 1 (current choice) : Compulsory Net Worth field in person and `VALIDATION_REGEX` calculated in dollars and must be more than 4 digits.**
    * Pros: Standardisation of currency and minimum net worth.
    * Cons: Unable to create a contact without knowing the client's net worth and net worth must be more than a
      minimum amount.

* **Choice 2 : Non-compulsory Net Worth field and `VALIDATION_REGEX` has no currency constraints nor minimum amount.**
    * Pros: Flexibility in creating a contact.
    * Cons: No means of comparison between a contact of different currency.

### Upcoming Meetings
The upcoming meetings feature allows the users to pull up a list of clients who he has a meeting with in the next 7 days. The upcoming meetings is represented with a `MeetingsWindow` that can be instantiated with the keyboard key `f2`.

Implementation of the upcoming meeting feature is built on top of [Meeting Feature]().

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: MeetingTime Object**
* **Choice 1 (current choice): Person object contains its own set of MeetingTime**
  * Pros: Easier to implement given the short amount of time
  * Cons: Harder to sort/filter/manipulate
* **Choice 2 (ideal choice): Bidirectional navigation between MeetingTime and Person**
  * Pros: Better abstraction therefore easier to perform MeetingTime specific tasks(e.g. sort, filter)
  * Cons: More complicated to implement

#### Related Features                                  
* [Sync Meetings feature](#sync-meetings-feature)        
* [Upcoming Meetings feature](#upcoming-meetings-feature)

### Sync Meetings feature

#### Implementation
The Sync Meetings feature is facilitated by the following operation:

* `Person#syncMeetingTimes()`â€‰â€”â€‰Iterates through all `MeetingTime`s a `Person` has and removes those that have passed.

This operation is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#syncMeetingTimes()`

#### Example Usage:
Step 1. User executes `sync`. `Model#syncMeetingTimes()` is called by `SyncCommand#execute(Model)`.

Step 2. `Model#syncMeetingTimes()` calls `AddressBook` which calls `UniquePersonList#syncMeetingTimes()`.

Step 3.  `UniquePersonList#syncMeetingTimes()` calls `Person#syncMeetingTimes()` for each person in `UniquePersonList#internalList`

Step 4. In `Person#syncMeetingTimes()`, the predicate `MeetingTimePastPredicate()` is passed into `MeetingTimes#removeIf(Predicate)` which removes meetings that are before the time of execution.

#### Design
<img src="images/MeetingDiagrams/SyncMeetingSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: Sync Meeting**
* **Choice 1 (current choice): In place filter of uniquePersonList**
  * Pros: Simple to implement
  * Cons: Hard to introduce undo logic
* **Choice 2: New instance of uniquePersonList when syncing**                       
  * Pros: Easy to introduce undo logic                                                   
  * Cons: Breaks singularity of address book in model or uniquePersonList in address book

### Upcoming Meetings feature

#### Implementation

The mechanism is facilitated by `MeetingsWindow`, `MeetingListPanel` and `MeetingCard`.

`MeetingsWindow` extends `UIPart<Stage>` and is linked to an FXML Menu Item `meetingsMenuItem` in `MainWindow`. This means that `MeetingsWindow` can be accessed from the menu bar as a menu item from the GUI as well.

The construction of `MainWindow` object, instantiates a `MeetingsWindow` object and `MainWindow#setAccelerator()` method is called.

The `MainWindow#setAccelerator()` method sets a shortcut that establishes a shortcut `f2` to the calling of `MainWindow#handleMeetings()` method.

`MainWindow#handleMeetings()` method calls `MeetingsWindow#getMeetings()` method that filters a list with `MeetingsWindow#isWithinOneWeek()` method returning an `ObservableList<Person>` of `Person` objects who have meetings from now till 7 days later.

The `ObservableList<Person>` is used to instantiate `MeetingCard` objects and populate the `MeetingListPanel`. The classes work in conjunction with the `.FXML` files to display the `MeetingCard` on a `MeetingListPanel` in a `MeetingsWindow`.

##### Example Usage

Step 1. User presses `f2` to see upcoming meetings.

Step 2. `f2` is set by `MainWindow#setAccelerator()` to call `MainWindow#handleMeetings()` method which in turn calls `MeetingsWindow#getMeetings()`.

Step 3. `MeetingsWindow#getMeetings()` method filters a list of `Person` objects by calling `MeetingsWindow#isWithinOneWeek()` method on the `Set<MeetingTime>` of each `Person`. The filtered list will contain `Person` objects that have meetings from now till 7 days later.

Step 4. `MeetingsWindow#getMeetings()` instantiates a `MeetingsListPanel` object where `MeetingsListPanel#updateItem()` method creates a `MeetingCard` for each `Person` in the list and the `MeetingsListPanel` is populated with `MeetingCard` objects on the `MeetingsWindow`.

The following sequence diagram shows how upcoming meetings feature works.
![UpcomingMeetingSequenceDiagram](images/DeveloperGuide/UpcomingMeetings/UpcomingMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows how upcoming meetings feature works.
![UpcomingMeetingActivityDiagram](images/DeveloperGuide/UpcomingMeetings/UpcomingMeetingActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Display**
**Choice 1 (Current Choice) : Pop up Meetings window.**
  * Pros:
    * Clear segregation from Main UI.
    * Does not take up real estate on the Main UI.
  * Cons:
    * Extra window to be created and managed.

**Choice 2 : Displayed on a section of Main Window.**
  * Pros:
    * No extra window to be managed.
  * Cons:
    * Cluttered UI.

**Meeting Card Display**
**Choice 1 (Current Choice) : Display Meetings Card by Person.**
  * Pros:
    * Clear distinction by client of the meetings that user will have with.
  * Cons:
    * Not intuitive for consolidated meetings in a day.

**Choice 2 : Display Meetings Card by date.**
  * Pros:
    * Intuitive consolidated meetings per day.
  * Cons:
    * Overhaul of new classes and object where a `MeetingTime` has-a `Person` rather than the current implementation of a `Person` has-a `MeetingTime`.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `UndoableCommands` and `CommandManager`.

`UndoableCommand` extends from `Command` and implements its own undo and redo methods. `Command`s that implement `UndoableCommand` include:
* `CreateCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes and adds saved person object for undo and redo methods respectively.
* `DeleteCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds and deletes saved person object for undo and redo methods respectively.
* `UpdateCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the original and edited person objects and sets them accordingly for undo and redo methods.
* `ClearCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the saved original address book and sets address book to new address book for undo and redo methods respectively.

`CommandManager` stores `UndoableCommand`s that have been executed and that have been undone in an `undoStack` and `redoStack` respectively. Additionally, `CommandManager` implements the following operations:

* `CommandManager#pushNewCommand(Command)`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the latest undoable command that was executed by user in its history.
* `CommandManager#undo(UndoableCommand)`â€‰â€”â€‰Undoes the last undoable command from the top of the undo-stack.
* `CommandManager#redo(UndoableCommand)`â€‰â€”â€‰Redoes the last undoable command from the top of the redo-stack.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#execute()`, `Logic#undo()` and `Logic#redo()` respectively.

#### Example Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandManger` will be initialized with an empty `undoStack` and `redoStack`.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. `CommandManager#pushNewCommand()` is called by `Logic#execute()`, saving the `DeleteCommand` in the `undoStack`.

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. `CommandManager#pushNewCommand()` is called by `Logic#execute()`, saving the `AddCommand` in the `undoStack`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `CommandManager#pushNewCommand()`, so the invalid command will not be saved into the `undoStack`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Logic#undo()` which calls `CommandManager#undo()` , which will pop the latest `UndoableCommand` from the `undoStack` and calls the `#UndoableCommand#undo()` method of that command which reverts the addressbook back to its previous state. The command popped is pushed to the `redoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo command works up till CommandManager:

<img src="images/UndoImplementationImages/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

The next sequence diagram shows how CommandManager executes undo:
<img src="images/UndoImplementationImages/CommandManagerUndoSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

<br>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Logic#redo()` which calls `CommandManager#redo()`, which pops the latest `UndoableCommand` from the `redostack` and calls the `UndoableCommand#redo()` of that command which reverts the addressbook to the state after the command execution. The command is added back to the `undoStack`.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not be added to the undoStack by `CommandManger#pushNewCommand()`. Thus, the `undoStack` remains unchanged.

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `CommandManager#pushNewCommand()`. Since there redoStack is not empty, `CommandManager#pushNewCommand` then calls `CommandManger#clearRedoStack`. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/UndoImplementationImages/PushCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**
* **Choice 1 (current choice) : Individual command knows how to undo/redo by**
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

* **Choice 2 : Saves the entire address book.**
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
