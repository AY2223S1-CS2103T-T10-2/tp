### Project: FABook

FABook is for mid-tier financial advisors who have to manage many current and potential clients. They often have trouble scheduling client meet-ups for both time and location as they have difficulty keeping track of clientsâ€™ information (name, address, portfolio).
They want a product to store all this information in one place.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: PDF Access
    * What it does: Users are able to assign PDFs absolute path in computer to client profiles.
    * Justification: Users are able to access their clients current plans and other information in an instant.
    * Highlights: By inputting the command, the PDF will open on the User's browser
    * Credits: Reused code from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2546968/open-pdf-file-on-the-fly-from-a-java-application)
