### Project: FABook

FABook is for mid-tier financial advisors who have to manage many current and potential clients. They often have trouble scheduling client meet-ups for both time and location as they have difficulty keeping track of clientsâ€™ information (name, address, portfolio).
They want a product to store all this information in one place.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
