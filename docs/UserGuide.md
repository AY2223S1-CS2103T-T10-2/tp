FABook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for a financial adviser to use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FABook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `FABook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/releases).

4. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your FABook.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`create`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the FABook.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `create n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `create n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [a/HOME_ADDRESS]` can be used as `n/John Doe a/Blk 30 Geylang Street 29` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `NAME…​` can be used as `Jon`, `Jon Jack` etc.

* `INDEX` represents the index of a specific person in the FABook
  e.g. `delete INDEX` can be used as `delete 2`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/HP_NUMBER`, `p/HP_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`,`clear`, 'redo' and 'undo') will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Partial words can be matched only if the whole name is included. e.g. `Jack` will match `Jackson`, but `Jackson` won’t match `Jack`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

:white_check_mark: **Tip:**

### Locating persons by address: `find`

Format: `find a/ADDRESS`

![findaddress](images/UserGuide/findaddress.png)     

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `serangoon` will match `Serangoon`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Kio Mo Ang` will match `Ang Mo Kio`

* Words can be matched only if the whole address is included. e.g. `Tamp` won’t match `Tampines`
* Persons with address matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Buona Clementi` will return `Buona Vista Drive`, `6 Clementi Ave`

:white_check_mark: **Tip:**

### Assigning PDF file to a person: `filepath`

Assigns a PDF file to a person in the FABook.

Format: `filepath INDEX f/FILEPATH`

![filepath](images/UserGuide/filepath.png) 

* INDEX is the index of the person in the currently displayed list.
* The filepath is the absolute path of the PDF on the local disk of the computer. e.g. `C:/Users/Ryzen/Downloads/CS2103T-T08-3.pdf`
* Only file paths that lead to a PDF is allowed. e.g. `C:/Users/Ryzen/Downloads/CS2103T-T08-3.docx` is an invalid filepath.
* Moving or renaming the PDF file in the local disk does not change the person's assigned file path, so you would have to assign it manually.

Examples:
* `filepath 2 f/C:/Users/Ryzen/Downloads/CS2103T-T08-3.pdf` assigns second person on the displayed list with the PDF file located at the absolute path `C:/Users/Ryzen/Downloads/CS2103T-T08-3.pdf`

### Opening PDF file of a person: `file`

Opens a person's assigned PDF file in user's PDF file viewer.

Format: `file INDEX`

![file](images/UserGuide/file.png)

* INDEX is the index of the person in the currently displayed list.
* Moving or renaming the PDF file in the local disk will cause the command to not work, which will require you to reassign a file path to the person again.

Examples:
* `file 2` opens the PDF file assigned to the second person in the displayed list.

### Remove past meetings: `sync`

Format: `sync`

![sync](images/UserGuide/sync.png)    

Removes every scheduled meeting time that has already passed.
   
* This uses your device's present local time as reference. All meetings scheduled to be earlier than the present time will removed.
   
:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Caution:**
As this command syncs with your device's system clock, please make sure the current date, time, and timezone are correct before using this command.
   
### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the FABook.

Format: `delete INDEX`

![delete](images/UserGuide/delete.png)
